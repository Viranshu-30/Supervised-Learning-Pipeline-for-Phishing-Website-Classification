# Supervised-Learning-Pipeline-for-Phishing-Website-Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements an intelligent phishing detection system using machine learning models, with a focus on **CatBoost**, **Random Forest**, **LightGBM**, and **Decision Tree** algorithms. The primary goal is to detect phishing websites in real time with high accuracy and low false negative rates.

The final application, **PhishGuard**, provides a web-based interface to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate using the trained CatBoost model.
